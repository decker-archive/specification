# Members
This Section Covers Venerette Members.

## Customization
Venera doesn't put much into the specification in terms of customization of a users' guild profile.
The specification only offers the ``nick``, ``avatar_url`` and ``banner_url`` parameters.

The ``nick`` should be no more than 45 characters and no less then 1.

The ``avatar_url`` and ``banner_url`` should be file type checked, if possible.

## Roles
As this is the member specification, we are only gonna put asigning roles here.

Roles use a system called "permission hierarchy," which states that if a role grants a permission, but a role above denies it the permission is denied and soforth the other way.

Members cannot assign roles, unless given the permission. The Member also needs to have a role higher then the role they're assigning or be the owner of the Venerette.

## Post Regulation
Venerette Moderators can regulate the types if posts posted to they're venerette, like only allowing image posts or video posts.

Venerette Moderators can also regulate the recommendation traction of certain posts on they're Venerettes Home Page if they find it misleading or inappropriate.

Posts cannot be, in anyway edited by a Moderator. Only the initial poster should be able to edit the Post.
